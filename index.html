        Big shoes, little cups, chains, doorknobs, diaries, receipts, and wedding presents we've never used. 
        There are things here that are not supposed be - we got so swept up in the relief of shedding detritus 
        from our lives. In retrospect, we will argue and search the house endlessly for the canopener that someone 
        walked away with. I will hide the sale of the vase, you will casually throw away my boots claiming that 
        they had been sold to young couple who just moved here.
        <br>
        <br>
        "Judies Going to Love this."
        <br>
        <br>
        "I didn't even know that they made <span id="sarcasm"> these</span>."
        <br>
        <br>
        I'll listen to the Astros lose while casually giving you a tour of my garbage. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "Why would you throw <span id ="sarcasm"> this </span> away"
        <br>
        <br>
        Late in the day someone will approach me with an object I haven't seen in years. 
        Thinking that I had lost it when we moved from chicago, ill announce that it's not for sale.
        The man will snicker and say "surely we can sort something out." He'll take out an old wallet
        and rifle through a file of fresh Twenties. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "I'm sorry but no."
        <br>
        <br>
        He'll leave after buying an ash tray and a chestnut cracker instead.
